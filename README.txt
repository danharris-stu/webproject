Project Description:

This webpage is designed to host a visual 'case opening' mini-game for an unofficial video game server host, who has turned into a 
business due to high popularity.

It is intended to be used to monetize upcoming console servers to sustain their rental cost.

The game will work by allowing users to purchase tokens from an external (already existing) web-store. Once tokens are added to the account
by admin validation, the user is able to 'open' a loot crate to win various types of in-game digital content.

Briefly, the site should contain the following features:

    -User sign up / sign in (with authentication), with logout feature to following

    -User profile page to link Steam ID (for prize delivery), see prize history, and see tokens remaining.

    -Webpage should have a route to the types of cases, in a grid

    -Clicking a case should bring you to the mini-game containing the reward table related to it.
    
    -Rewards will be generated using a randomization alogorithim (taking into consideration item rarity) and stored securely in a database
    
    -On each case page, there will be a spin button to start the mini-game animation and deduct a token from the user account and allocate the
prize to the user's account.

    -Web page should also include general web UX features such as: About, Support, Client's primary website link
    
    -Support page should allow user to send an e-mail to the client's helpdesk account (already existing) through web interface
    
    -Admin panel for web page owner to create escalated privilege accounts for admin/support team.
    
    -Escalated privilege accounts can enter a user ID in the private web interface to add purchased tokens to/remove refunded 
tokens from user accounts
    
    -Escalated privilege accounts can disable user accounts (breaking code of conduct, requesting account closure)
